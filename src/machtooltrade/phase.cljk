  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the precision-machinery-wholesale
  actor.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- machine-order intake allowed, every
                                 write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds contract-verification writes,
                                 still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:order/intake` (no capital/export-
                                 control risk yet) may auto-commit.
                                 `:delivery/dispatch`/`:invoice/settle`
                                 NEVER auto-commit, at any phase.

  `:delivery/dispatch`/`:invoice/settle` are deliberately ABSENT from
  every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent
  structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Physically
  dispatching a real machine tool to a counterparty and settling a
  real invoice (real money moving between counterparty and
  wholesaler) are the two real-world acts this actor performs; both
  are always a human trading supervisor / export-compliance officer's
  call. `machtooltrade.governor`'s high-stakes gate enforces the same
  invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on this. Like
  every prior sibling's phase 3 `:auto` set, this domain has only ONE
  member (`:order/intake`) -- no separate no-capital-risk lifecycle
  distinct from the machine-order itself.")
